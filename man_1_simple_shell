.SH DESCRIPTION
.B HSH executes commands read from the standard input or from a file stdout.this Simple shell is a kind of Bourne Shell.It works without any option because it's a more simple shell.HSH doesn't have all the bashs builtins to, because we didn't want to complex the simple shell. Hsh can execute binaries, scripts from anywhere if there are in a folder of the environnement variable $PATH. You can execute only one binary, script per line. Hsh can takes options from commands.
